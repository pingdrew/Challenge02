## Description
Project created for the Coders Bootcamp Pre-Work

Motivaton for giving this project such time and attention came from my desire to use this template in my final project and to scrap pieces off of this website for every future venture. I want this website to look nice and it is the first real website I have published since the pre-work. I really wanted to see if I could make something I would genuinely consider pretty and I did.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

simply look at the page, and read my comments for how the code works

## Credits

All credits go to a previous activity where you were fixing the cards showing items in a shop. I took the concept and applied that to my own work here. Cards displaying projects I have done. I did all of this and double checked it myself, getting some feedback from peers along the way.

## Tests

Open the page, and change the size of the screen to anything. It should be responsive and still look presentable and clean
